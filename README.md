DISCLAIMER
----------

This is **not a mature** product. Still under construction.
There are no guarantees for cross browser compatibility.

And <https://raw.github.com> does not provide proper mime type, I put theme files into [gh-pages branch](<https://github.com/lqez/flat-jenkins/tree/gh-pages>).
There is <https://rawgithub.com> out there, but I don't want to harass them.
